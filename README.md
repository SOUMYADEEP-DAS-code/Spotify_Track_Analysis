🧩 Problem Statement

With millions of tracks available on Spotify, understanding what makes a song popular is crucial for artists, producers, and marketers.
This project aims to:

Identify the key musical and audio features influencing popularity.

Explore relationships among tempo, valence, loudness, and energy.

Provide recommendations for creating data-informed music strategies.

🧠 Summary of Findings

🎶 Average Track Duration: ~4.18 minutes; majority fall between 3.5–5 minutes.

🔑 Most Common Key: C major and A minor dominate popular tracks.

⚡ Energy vs. Popularity: Moderate to high-energy songs perform best.

💃 Danceability: Tracks with medium-high danceability are more likely to be popular.

🎧 Loudness & Tempo: Popular songs cluster around -8 dB and 110–130 BPM.

🚀 Key Takeaways

The combination of energy, danceability, and moderate loudness strongly predicts popularity.

Emotional tone (valence) has less correlation with popularity than rhythm and structure.

Data-driven insights can help artists align their music with audience preferences.
